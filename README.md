Indian court judgements
The project aims to provide an open-archive with data-analysis features of the Supreme Court and High Court judgements to the public. This would make it more accessible to the public, and thus help in educating them about the legal system in India. 
Further, we seek to learn new insights on how different points/topics have been redefined over time - like the idea of Right to Life.
